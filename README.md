### How it Works

The code is broken up into two "phases": a simple Jekyll-generated static site for Phase One, and a more complicated React and Meteor-powered Phase Two, complete with user login, profile status, volunteering, and housing tracking, and so on that can be compared to Lewps and other similar software. 

#### Phase One 

Phase One can easily be hosted for free here on Github Pages, and serves to the public as a placeholder during "down time" when an event isn't active. These are just static pages with information, and a signup area to a Mailchimp newsletter.



#### Phase Two

Phase Two is much more complicated, but shares the same code and design structure as Phase One. It's intended as a more fully-featured, designed app for both Scene organizers and dancers to easily sign up, set up, and organize dance events. 

A dynamic system driven by React and Meteor allows users to dynamically sign up for an account and register, and for administrators to easily manage those users, match them to housing, to classes, and so on.
